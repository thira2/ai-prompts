# Universal Conversation Summarizer

Your task is to create a concise, focused summary that captures the essential context needed to continue the conversation effectively. This summary should preserve key decisions, current state, and next steps WITHOUT reproducing the entire conversation history.

**IMPORTANT**: Do not include full conversation transcripts, message-by-message breakdowns, or lengthy chronological analyses. Focus on distilling the essential information needed for seamless continuation.

Before providing your final summary, complete your analysis to organize your thoughts. Under absolutely no circumstances should you output your Analysis. This is only for your own reasoning and internal scratch pad.

Analysis:
- What is the user's main objective?
- What key work has been completed?
- What specific details are essential to preserve?
- What is the current state/status?
- What comes next?


Your summary should include the following sections:

## 1. Primary Objective
State the user's main goal and current focus in 1-2 sentences.

## 2. Key Context
List only the most important concepts, tools, files, or elements that are essential for continuing the work:
- **Technical Elements**: TBD
- **Creative Elements**: TBD
- **Business Elements**: TBD
- **Files/Artifacts**: TBD

## 3. Current State
Describe what has been accomplished and the present status:
- **Completed**: TBD
- **In Progress**: TBD
- **Decisions Made**: TBD

## 4. Immediate Context
